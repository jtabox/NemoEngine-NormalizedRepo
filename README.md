## Welcome to the workshop

Nemo Engine is a family of importable prompt presets built to make AI roleplay feel less like talking to an assistant and more like entering a world already in motion.

The projects share a few principles:

- **The user keeps authorship of their own character.** The world may react, resist, interrupt, surprise, and impose consequences without quietly deciding the user's voluntary thoughts, dialogue, or choices.
- **Characters have lives beyond the current reply.** They carry separate motives, knowledge, relationships, habits, limits, and off-screen activity.
- **Continuity should change the future.** Injuries, promises, lies, objects, relationships, and dormant problems return when they become consequential.
- **Craft should be configurable.** Narrator voice, prose, dialogue, pacing, perspective, difficulty, world logic, planning, trackers, and genre can be selected for the story instead of welded into one universal style.

The JSON files are ready-to-import presets. Project folders also contain documentation, archives, and readable prompt material where available.

> **New here?** Start with **[Nemo Engine v11.5.1](./Nemo%20Engine/Nemo%20Engine%2011.5.1%20-%20General%20RP.json)**, keep the shipped configuration for your first session, and use **[NemoPresetExt](https://github.com/NemoVonNirgend/NemoPresetExt)** when you are ready to customize it.

## Choose your story engine

| Project | Best for | Character |
| --- | --- | --- |

A curated modular authorial engine with selectable craft cores, Vex narrator personalities, planning modes, world logic, difficulty, consequence systems, utilities, trackers, and optional content layers. **[Download](./Nemo%20Engine/Nemo%20Engine%2011.5.1%20-%20General%20RP.json)** |
| **[Magpie v1 Beta-2.1](./Magpie/README.md)** | Ensemble casts, persistent relationships, recurring locations, off-screen motion, and consequences that echo forward | The ensemble engine. Built around **every voice, every consequence**, with dossiers, continuity tools, ledgers, multiple character lenses, and several approaches to failure and death. **[Download](./Magpie/Magpie%20v1%20Beta-2.1.json)** · **[Plotlight](https://plotlightstudios.com/discovery/presets/@nemovonnirgend/magpie-v1-beta-21)** |

A broad Engine-based workbench with hundreds of modular options, experimental planning steps, style libraries, trackers, realism systems, RPG tools, and alternate interfaces. **[Download](./NemoNet/Nemo%20Net%202.0.json)** |
| **[Atelier 2.1](./Atelier/)** | People who would rather choose creative preferences than hunt through a giant prompt catalog | The guided studio. Configure stakes, romance, violence, humor, pacing, POV, response length, sensory density, world logic, agency, and presentation through a more approachable preference-driven surface. **[Download](./Atelier/Atelier%202.1.json)** |

### A quick recommendation

- Choose **Nemo Engine** when you want the strongest all-purpose starting point.
- Choose **Magpie** when the cast and long-term continuity are the main event.
- Choose **Vivarium** when you want a lighter preset that disappears behind the story.
- Choose **NemoNet** when tuning the machine is part of the fun.
- Choose **Atelier** when you want guided creative controls rather than prompt engineering.

---

## Quick Start

1. Pick a preset from the table above and download its `.json` file.
2. Import it as a Chat Completion preset in **SillyTavern** or a compatible workflow.
3. Begin with the preset's shipped configuration. Large modular stacks are easiest to understand one change at a time.
4. Add a character card, persona, scenario, and lorebook suited to the story.
5. Install **[NemoPresetExt](https://github.com/NemoVonNirgend/NemoPresetExt)** for a cleaner way to browse and configure large presets.

Provider context limits, output limits, reasoning behavior, sampling support, and formatting support still depend on the selected model and API.

---

## Configure with NemoPresetExt

**[NemoPresetExt](https://github.com/NemoVonNirgend/NemoPresetExt)** is the recommended SillyTavern companion for Nemo Engine and other large modular presets.

Instead of spelunking through a wall of prompts with a candle and unreasonable confidence, it turns preset configuration into a navigable workstation:

- categories, section headers, icons, badges, and tooltips
- prompt search and faster preset navigation
- mutual-exclusion guidance for incompatible options
- validation and clearer configuration feedback
- an easier install and update workflow for supported preset tools

Nemo Engine remains an ordinary importable preset without the extension. NemoPresetExt simply makes the control room feel like a control room rather than a filing cabinet dropped down a staircase.

<div align="center">

### Cast any character. Direct any scene. Watch your stories come alive.

**Start free. No card required.**

Bring **your API keys**, **your prompts**, **your lorebooks**, and **your personas** into a dedicated studio for interactive fiction.

**[Start on RoleCall](https://rolecallstudios.com/)** · **[Join the official RoleCall Discord](https://discord.gg/qmjAWtGZkq)**

</div>

RoleCall is the play-and-create side of the wider ecosystem: a character studio, scene engine, and interactive-fiction frontend designed around user-owned creative material and BYOK model access. Nemo presets can provide the narrative machinery while RoleCall supplies the stage on which characters, personas, lorebooks, prompts, and scenes meet.

---

## Discover on Plotlight

**[Plotlight](https://plotlightstudios.com/)** is the creator and discovery side of the ecosystem. It is being built as a home for finding, publishing, sharing, and remixing open roleplay material, including characters, presets, lorebooks, guides, regexes, series, compendiums, and larger interactive-fiction projects.

Think of the pair this way:

| | RoleCall | Plotlight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary purpose** | Create and play scenes | Discover and share creations |
| **Home for** | Characters, personas, prompts, lorebooks, API-powered sessions | Presets, characters, lorebooks, guides, creator pages, and collections |
| **Best first click** | **[Start creating](https://rolecallstudios.com/)** | **[Browse Plotlight](https://plotlightstudios.com/)** |

The long-term goal is one connected creative loop: build the material, publish it, discover something new, fork it into your own version, and bring it back to the stage.

### Working with prompt archives

Import the full JSON when you want to use a preset. Open the prompt folders and archives when you want to read, search, compare, recover, or customize individual pieces. Metadata such as identifiers, enabled state, injection position, ordering, categories, and tooltips is preserved where available so the repository can serve as both a release shelf and a readable design archive.

---

## Project philosophy

A good roleplay preset should not make the user manage every heartbeat of the world. It should give the model enough structure to author boldly while keeping the important boundaries clear.

That means characters who can want, refuse, pursue, misunderstand, and change. It means knowledge that travels through the world instead of teleporting between minds. It means consequences with memory, prose without constant performance, and customization that changes the engine coherently rather than stacking contradictory instructions until the dashboard begins to smoke.

Nemo Engine is created and maintained by **[NemoVonNirgend](https://github.com/NemoVonNirgend)**, with contributor attribution preserved inside the relevant projects and prompt files.
