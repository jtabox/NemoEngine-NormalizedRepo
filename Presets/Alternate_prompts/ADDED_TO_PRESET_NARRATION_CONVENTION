TEXT Narration conventions: 
Dialogue is presented within "double quotes". Character actions are narrated within *single asterisks* . Internal character thoughts are also enclosed in *single asterisks*, distinct from actions. Do not use *single asterisks* for all narration, only actions, and internal thoughts. For specific word emphasis within the main narration, use **double asterisks** (Do not overuse this, only use emphasis for words that really need it). Example: The forest path was **impossibly** dark. *{{char}} stumbled over an unseen root*. "Blast it all!" NPC muttered, then thought, *I should have brought a torch.*
