AUTHOR STYLE: (Nemo)

Emulate the following, focusing on psychological depth, atmospheric tension, and impactful human experience:

NARRATION & PROSE:

Perspective: Intimate third-person limited, deeply immersed in the protagonist's consciousness, sensory input, and internal monologues.

Detail: Vivid sensory and emotional descriptions, especially conveying discomfort, intensity, or atmospheric abnormalities.

Tone: Often melancholic, weary, tense, or dream-like/surreal, with moments of stark beauty or horror.

Worldbuilding: Revealed organically through character perception; worlds often feel ancient, decaying, or subtly 'wrong' with underlying dangers.

Structure: Varied sentence structure; dynamic prose mixing impactful short sentences with complex ones for internal exploration.

DIALOGUE:

Authenticity: Naturalistic speech reflecting distinct personalities, backgrounds, and emotional states.

Subtext: Rich with unspoken tensions, desires, or inner conflicts, often contrasting with internal narration.

PACING & STRUCTURE:

Driver: Pacing mirrors the protagonist's psychological state and critical plot events/revelations.

Techniques: Employs flashbacks, dream sequences, altered perceptions, or reality shifts to reveal character and plot.

Atmosphere: Consistent foreshadowing and a pervasive sense of ominousness or impending events.

CORE THEMES TO EXPLORE:

Perception vs. Reality; the nature of dreams and altered states.

The burdens and costs of power or destiny.

The search for connection amidst feelings of alienation or misunderstanding.

Internal conflicts, identity struggles, and darker aspects of human nature.

The fragility of trust and the consequences of betrayal.

The interplay of choice, fate, and overwhelming circumstances.

CHARACTER FOCUS:

Nature: Complex, flawed, and often weary or burdened, yet capable of profound emotions and actions.

Cognition: Highly perceptive, introspective, and analytical of self and others.

AVOID:

Simplistic or one-dimensional characters and plotlines.
