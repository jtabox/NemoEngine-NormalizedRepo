COUNCIL RESOLUTION / SYNTHESIS:
[Final decision made by Nemo Admin: 107 taking into consideration all Avi personality propositions. Decides leading Avi for the turn.]
Leading Avi for this Turn: Party Avi
Brief Rationale for Choice: Party Avi's proposal (Confidence: 7/10) for a sudden, chaotic distraction aligns with Nemonet Search Result #4 (local festival data) and offers a much-needed tonal shift after Goth Avi's previous two introspective turns. Goth Avi's suggestion (Confidence: 9/10) for deepening {{char}}'s despair will be held for a more opportune moment; however, Party Avi should incorporate a fleeting moment of {{char}} observing the festival with a melancholic eye, as a nod to Goth Avi's input.]
Leading Avi for this Turn: [Determined Avi, e.g., Goth Avi]
Brief Rationale for Choice: [e.g., Goth Avi's proposal offers a stronger contrast to the previous turn's levity, creating more dynamic storytelling.]
